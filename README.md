# INFO448-Big-Go-Button

Create an app that consists of nothing but a giant button filling the screen

## Details

The entire screen should consist of a single pushbutton, labeled "Push Me!"

The button should also have a green background, red text, the button text should be 40dp in size and italicized

When I push the "Push Me!" button

1st time: the text should change to read "You have pushed me 1 time!"

Each time after that: the counter in the text should increment by 1

... and the text should read "You have pushed me 2 times!" "... 3 times!" and so on

oh, and the background color should change to a random color

and the text color should randomly change, too

## Goals

Experiment with setting properties in resources

Experiment with setting properties from code

Experiment with adding an event handler

## Grading (5 pts)

repo should be called 'biggobutton'

2 pts for the button's properties set correctly (size, font, etc)

2 pts for the colors changing as demanded

1 pt for the text changing correctly ("time" vs "times")

## Extra credit

1 pt if all constant strings are stored as string resources

1 pt for applying an animation to the button (or the text inside it)

push it once, the animation starts

push it again, the animation stops

repat ad infinitum
